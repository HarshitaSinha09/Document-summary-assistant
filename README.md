## 🌟 Vision & Purpose  

Information overload from **research papers, scanned documents, and reports** often creates inefficiency. This project was conceived as an **intelligent assistant** that automates:  
- Text extraction from complex file types  
- Semantic compression of content using AI  
- Instant generation of structured, length-customizable summaries

## 🧭 End-to-End User Flow  

1. **Ingestion Layer** → Upload or drag & drop a PDF/image file  
2. **Configuration Panel** → Select summary length (Concise • Standard • Comprehensive)  
3. **Processing Pipeline** → OCR + NLP-driven summarization in real time  
4. **Output Layer** → Receive well-structured summaries, ready for reuse

## ⚙️ System Architecture & Design Rationale  

- **Client-Centric Processing** → All computation executed in-browser, ensuring **data privacy and zero server dependency**  
- **SPA Workflow Orchestration** → Unified pipeline: Input → Processing → Output  
- **Resilience Engineering:**  
  - Progressive rendering during parsing & summarization  
  - Error boundaries for oversized or malformed inputs  
- **UX Engineering:**  
  - Adaptive grid system for mobile-first responsiveness  
  - Cognitive load reduction through staged interactions  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  - Demo utilizes client-exposed API key (⚠️ insecure in production)  
  - Production-ready model requires **serverless proxy integration**
