## 🚀 Execution Framework  

- **Problem-Solving Strategy** → Designed as a fully client-side solution to **reduce backend dependencies** while maintaining high functionality. Leveraged trusted libraries like **PDF.js** and **Tesseract.js** for robust text extraction, integrated with **Cohere AI services** to deliver adaptive summarization.  

- **System Architecture** → Structured as a **single-page application** with progressive enhancement. Begins with simple file ingestion, evolves through text/OCR processing, and concludes in AI-driven summarization. The **two-phase workflow** ensures clarity while keeping interactions lightweight.  

- **User Experience Engineering** → Integrated **dynamic feedback loops** including loading indicators, error notifications, and responsive layouts. The drag-and-drop interface gives **instant visual feedback**, while **typography and spacing** make the interface easily scannable. 

- **Strategic Technical Choices** → Opted for **vanilla JavaScript** to maintain a lean bundle size and simplify deployment. **PDF.js** enables complex multi-page parsing, **Tesseract.js** powers image OCR, and **Cohere API** introduces customizable, context-aware summarization.  

- **Performance Optimization** → Built with **progressive loading states** and **error boundaries** to gracefully handle large or corrupted files. Entirely **client-side processing** guarantees user privacy while simultaneously minimizing infrastructure costs.
